Collection Used: HashMap

Rationale:
In our game project, a HashMap is used to manage the player's inventory. It allows fast lookups, additions, and deletions using item names as keys. This makes managing a growing inventory efficient, especially when needing to quickly retrieve or update specific items.

Class using the collection: InventoryManager

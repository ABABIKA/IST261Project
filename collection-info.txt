Collection Used: HashSet

Rationale:
In our game project, a HashSet is used to track which puzzles or rooms a player has completed or visited. HashSet makes it easy to check if a task has already been done, and it prevents duplicates automatically. This keeps performance fast and logic clean.

Class using the collection: ProgressManager
